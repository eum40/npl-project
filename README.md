# NLP Disaster Tweets Classification (Homework Project)

This repository contains my code and analysis for a homework assignment using the [Kaggle NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) dataset. The goal is to classify tweets as disaster-related or not, using NLP techniques and machine learning.

## Project Summary
- Data source: Kaggle Disaster Tweets
- Main steps: EDA, text cleaning, TF-IDF feature extraction, Logistic Regression, and planned (not executed) LSTM neural network.
- For reproducibility, download `train.csv` and `test.csv` from Kaggle.
